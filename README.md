# A/B Testing for Landing Page Engagement
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d23a9e05-2077-47ca-b2bf-875b453926c3)


This project performs an A/B test to determine which landing page (A or B) retains users for a longer duration, indicating higher engagement.

## Overview

This project performs an **A/B testing statistical analysis** to compare user engagement between two different landing pages ‚Äî **Page A** and **Page B**. The goal is to identify which page leads to longer user interactions, using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **statistical hypothesis testing** techniques.

If you're interested in data-driven decision-making, website optimization, or learning practical A/B testing using Python, this notebook is a valuable hands-on resource.


## Key Question

**Do users spend more time on Landing Page B compared to Landing Page A, suggesting higher engagement and better selling potential?**

## üöÄ Key Features

- ‚úÖ Clean and structured **pandas-based data analysis**
- üìà Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- üìä **Box plots, histograms, violin plots** for page comparison
- üß™ **Hypothesis testing** using **t-tests** with SciPy
- ‚úÖ Detects significant differences in page engagement
- üì¶ Readable and reproducible Jupyter notebook

## üìÅ Dataset

- **File Name:** `web_page_data.csv`
- **Source:** Kaggle (A/B Testing Dataset)
- **Columns:**
  - `Page`: Type of landing page (`PAGE A`, `PAGE B`)
  - `Time`: Time spent on the page (multiplied by 100 to convert to hundredths of seconds)

## Analysis

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    * Loads the data using Pandas.
    * Displays the first few rows to understand the data structure.
    * Converts the `Time` column from minutes to seconds for easier interpretation.
    * Examines data types and missing values.
    * Provides descriptive statistics of the `Time` column.

2.  **Visualizations:**
    * Box Plot ‚Äì Compare distributions and outliers across pages.
    * Histogram with KDE ‚Äì View the frequency distribution of engagement time.
    * Violin Plot ‚Äì Detailed comparison of distribution shapes.

3.  **Statistical Analysis:**
    * **Normality Check:**
        * Uses the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess if the time spent on each page follows a normal distribution.
        * Visualizes the data with histograms and Q-Q plots to further inspect normality.
    * **Homogeneity of Variance Check:**
        * Applies Levene's test to determine if the variances of the two groups (Page A and Page B) are equal.
    * **Hypothesis Testing:**
        * Performs the Mann-Whitney U test (a non-parametric test) to compare the time spent on the two pages, as the data for Page A is not normally distributed.
        * States the null hypothesis (H0: There is no difference in time spent on Page A and Page B) and the alternative hypothesis (H1: Users spend more time on one page than the other).
        * Determines statistical significance based on the p-value.

## Findings

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Provides summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for time spent on each page.
* **Normality Test Results:** Indicates whether the data for each page is normally distributed.
* **Variance Test Results:** Shows if the variances of the two groups are equal.
* **Mann-Whitney U Test Results:**
    * Reports the U statistic and p-value.
    * States whether the null hypothesis is rejected or not.
    * Interprets the practical significance of the findings in terms of user engagement.

## Conclusion

The analysis concludes whether there is a statistically significant difference in the time users spend on Landing Page A versus Landing Page B. It provides insights into which page design is more effective at engaging users, which can inform decisions about website design and marketing strategies.
